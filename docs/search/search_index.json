I have extensive interests in artificial intelligence and scientific computing. My research contributes to the scientific foundations of artificial intelligence to enable new computational abstraction, learning, and decision-making capabilities. <p>Research Highlights</p> An Improved U-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Liquid Spray Images <p> Lyner Lim, a PhD student under my co-supervision, has developed an improved U-Net algorithm. The algorithm applies Gaussian filtering on training data as an inductive bias to enhance the receptive sensitivity of convolutional feature learning in a U-Net. The objective is to perform a better semantic segmentation of liquid spray images in spray applications. The proposed Gaussian induction diffuses sharp edges into a regularised coarse edges at the contour boundaries. This maximizes the visibility of the contour boundary in the eyes of the receptive field of a convolutional feature extractor. Therefore, it allows the convolutional feature extractor in the U-Net to efficiently differentiate between the geometrical formation of the outward contour boundary and the inward contour boundary through a transitional pixel-level dissimilarity measure to confidently segment the detected contour into the correct class. The experimental results demonstrate the improved U-Net has outperformed the basic U-Net in segmenting the key droplets, an important requirement in spray applications.

Then, I moved my research focus to convolutional neural networks for computer vision. When exploring convolutional neural networks and their visual feature learning capability, I thought of conceptualizing them with high-level mathematical abstraction. Perhaps, with a bit of learning from the fundamentals of cognition to guide the abstraction. I began working on subspace representation and functional composition to extend my understanding of convolutional visual learning in high-dimensional data analysis and low-dimensional data synthesis. That work progressed me from discriminative learning to generative autoencoding for visual feature extraction, modeling, and inference.    I was recently introduced to category theory and have embarked on a journey to learn it. It is motivating to know how this community sweats its effort to build a mathematical bridge between categories and artificial intelligence. I am slowly taking steps to learn more about categories and how they can conceptualize convolutional learning systems, be they visual, linguistic, or time series. I believe that category theory would enable me to create profound mathematical abstractions for the convolutional learning system that potentially incorporates the fundamentals of cognition. Then, I could utilize this knowledge to augment machine-level perceptions with new explainabilities and capabilities. The end-point outcomes of this research are still too early to judge, but I am excited about a promising and fulfilling journey waiting for me.
